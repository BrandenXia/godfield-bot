# godfield-sim

This optional native package contains the batched C++20 curriculum simulator.
It is built and installed from the repository root with:

```console
uv sync --extra simulation --group dev
```

Every included curriculum is intentionally incomplete and its generated
trajectories are not eligible for live model promotion. The broadest current
ruleset, `same-damage-weapon-resource-hand`, includes elemental multi-card
combat, HP/MP utility, fixed and chance miracles, Absorption, reusable additive
miracles, evidence-bounded one-hop reflection, seven fixed ATK/DEF weapons, 14
effect-free chance weapons, and the chance/defense dual role of Jinn's Rocking
Horse. It additionally models all three evidenced HP-absorbing weapons,
including actual-damage healing and reflected ownership, Magical Stick's
current-MP attack and all-MP consumption, and Evil Broadsword's post-defense
same-damage effect with lethal-target short-circuiting. The unobserved
same-damage/reflection interaction remains masked. See ADR 0002 and ADRs 0029
through 0036 in the root project for the interface and safety boundary.
